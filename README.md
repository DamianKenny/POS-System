# POS-System for a Grocery Store

A POS System for a Grocery Store i made for my Enterprise Application Development Coursework project,

The system includes of two sub-systems - A POS system and a product management system which will be available on a dashboard.
In the product management system you will be able to Add, Update and Delete the products which are in the system and database,
while also you can view reports made with Crystal Reports based on the products on a separate User-Interface.

The POS system includes all the products which are added into the system, you can select all the products and it will show you the
number of items, and at the end the total amount for all the items. You can add the amount of money paid by the customer and calculate
the balance needed to give the customer, and a bill will be printed based on all the information such as All the products, paid amount,
total and Balance to be paid.
